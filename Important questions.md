| What are the major changes that an entity has to make in order to go live on Rebit 2.x specs | 1. Implement the specs as stated on [ReBiT portal](https://api.rebit.org.in/) 
2. Test the implementation of the GET API in the CR as per the new format. You can refer to the following entities in the CR to understand the new format- AA00023400. 
3. Test the implementation in the UAT environment, for finding AAs that are live, refer to [this link](dummy_link_2). 
4. Get the entity certified. To know the status of readiness of certifiers, please refer to [this link](dummy_link_3). |
| Do entities need to create a new entry in the CR for their version implementation of ReBit 2.x specs | "No, Entities do need to create a new entry in the CR to declare their readiness for ReBit 2.x specs. CR can host the endpoint of ReBit 2.0 specs by updating the base URL in the following format `v1:<url for v1>, v2:<url for v2>`"                                                                                                               |
| How do entities declare their readiness for ReBit 2.x specs    | "Entities need to send an updated JSON as per the prescribed format for the base URL and send the request to [services@sahamati.org.in](mailto:services@sahamati.org.in) Entities can also use the CR Onboarding API to update their entity as per the agreed-upon format for the base URL."                                                                         |
